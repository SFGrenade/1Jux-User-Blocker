Open this Link: https://github.com/SFGrenade/1Jux-User-Blocker/raw/master/1jux_user_blocker.user.js  
Then click on install.

## How to use
On every post there should be a red or green text with "Block" or "Unblock" added by this script.  
With these you can easily block/unblock users.  
For a more complete look over the list of blocked users, there also is a "Blocked Users" button in the profile drop-down menu, which shows a list of all users that you blocked.
